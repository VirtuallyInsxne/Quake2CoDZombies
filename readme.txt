How to Use the CoD Zombies Mod
Within the game everything will be done through commands in the console. If you wish to have the help screen pop up, just type the command cmd howtostartround. Once you have familiarized yourself with how the game will be run, you can use the command cmd startround to start your first round. Now the rounds will not continue once you have killed every enemy. It will only continue if you run the same command again because this will give you time to use the command cmd openshop to use the points you have obtained from defeating enemies to buy one of 5 perks. After all that, all you have to do is survive for as long as you can.
