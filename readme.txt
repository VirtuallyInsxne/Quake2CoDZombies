How to Use the CoD Zombies Mod
Within the game everything will be done through commands in the console. 
If you wish to have the help screen pop up, just type the command cmd modhelp. 
Once you have familiarized yourself with how the game will be run, you can use the command cmd startround to start your first round. 
Now the rounds will not continue once you have killed every enemy. 
It will only continue if you run the same command again.
This will give you time to use the command cmd openshop to use the points you have obtained from defeating enemies to buy one of 5 perks and 1 extra option.
These 5 perks include the following:
  1) Increased Health
  2) Max Armor
  3) Increased Speed
  4) Gamble Weapon
  5) Extra Ammo
The extra option is the ability to give yourself 50 bullets for 300 points.
In order to buy 1 of these 6 options you must go into the console and press the perks number into the command console. If you have enough points you will be given the perk. 
After all that, all you have to do is survive for as long as you can.
